#Snap game
- There is a fairness test in GameTest.scala which runs a lot of game to see if it is fair to both players.
- Game State and Game logic can be decoupled by having repo classes for state and service classes for business logic. But didn't spend time to do that

## Run the game
```shell script
sbt run
```
## Run the test
```shell script
sbt test
```
